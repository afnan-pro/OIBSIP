🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
AICTE OASIS INFOBYTE - Data Science Internship Task 1

📝 Project Description
This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their measurements. The model achieves 93.33% accuracy using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

🔑 Key Insights
Species Separation: Setosa is easily distinguishable from Versicolor and Virginica
Feature Importance: Petal measurements are more discriminative than sepal measurements
Model Selection: SVM with RBF kernel outperforms other models for this multiclass problem
Data Preprocessing: Proper feature scaling significantly improves model performance
Accuracy Trade-off: 93.33% accuracy is excellent for real-world iris classification

📚 Code Highlights
Model Training Example
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Train SVM model
svm_model = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)
svm_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"SVM Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
# Output: 0.9333
